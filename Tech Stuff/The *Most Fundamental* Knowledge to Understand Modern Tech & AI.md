# Why these?
  
Because **these are the *core mathematical and computational pillars* that underlie nearly everything in modern AI and tech**:

- **Deep learning?** Linear algebra + calculus + optimization + probability.
- **Data science?** Probability + statistics + algorithms.
- **Software engineering?** Algorithms + data structures + programming.
- **Signal processing, compression, communication?** Information theory + linear algebra.

# What *not* to focus on as fundamentals:

- Specific tools (Docker, Kubernetes, PyTorch)
- Frameworks or libraries
- Hype cycles or surface-level trends
