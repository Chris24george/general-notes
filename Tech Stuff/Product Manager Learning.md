The whole point of this doc is to do some product management reading, connect it to my own experience (with some practical examples/exercises so I solidify the concepts in my mind), and note down what I learned. 

This is all so that I can have a pretty good sense of "product manager speak" when potentially interviewing etc. Yes, it can be quite boring, but it is a clear signal that I know what I am talking about. It looks bad to not know the basic definitions, acronyms, and tools of the field.
