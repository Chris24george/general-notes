### 4/8/25: On Idleness
Read "On Idleness" today. He talks about fallow ground and how many useless roots and plants grow when not seeded. He uses this metaphor to explain how minds also need "seed" of purpose in order to be at their best. He is funny, he says in his idleness his mind has created a bunch of monsters, and he hopes to use writing as a way to get them all out on the page and expose his mind to justifiable ridicule.
