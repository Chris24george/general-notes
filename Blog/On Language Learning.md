Imagine you decide to learn Spanish in your free time. Maybe you took a couple of levels of Spanish in school when you were younger. You had hopes that by congugating enough verbs or memorizing vocabulary lists you would be dancing the tango (badly) and seducing everyone around you with your sweet, [insert Spanish-speaking country here] accent. You saw an ad for Duolingo that made you feel bad about yourself for not putting in the work you should have put in. You decide, "okay, that's it. I'm **finally** going to learn Spanish". You download the app. You spend a few months building a streak by translating sentences like "Roberto sits on the platypus". You feel good. You feel like you can finish those lessons quicker and quicker. Then you go to a taquería and realize you don't even know where to start in holding any practical conversation. Okay, no problem. You hire a tutor. You start doing homework every week and starting to speak. But it is painful, it is embarrasing and it hurts your brain. "I don't have time for this crap", you tell yourself. "Maybe if I had a year off I could finally dedicate the time and space I need to learn this". You put it aside, **yet again**. You read some blog posts about how the optimal time to learn a language is when you are in the womb, or better yet, starting at conception. You scroll TikTok and see videos of people rubbing their success in your face. You feel dejected. Luckily, you happen to stumble upon this intersting blog called Christo Notes and see a post titled "On Language Learning"...

There are many people with many opinions on the "correct" way to learn a language. A lot of them post or make videos on the internet. If you are trying, or have tried in the past, to learn a language, I'm sure you have encountered some of this content. Some of it is narrowly useful, some of it is engagement bait, but none of it really gets to the heart of what really allows someone to be succesful in learning a language. The short answer is that success in learning a language is approximately proportional to *quality* time spent engaging with the language. Of course, saying that doesn't really help anyone understand what to *do*, so I will try to give a longer, more nuanced perspective that can hopefully be of some use.

First of all, I know what I am talking about. I have learned (to varying degrees of fluency) 9 languages on my own. I am a native English Speaker. I have spoken and understood Russian since childhood, but I was never really fluent until I took the initiative to bring my level to fluency as a teenager. After Russian, I went on to study Spanish, German, French, Greek, Ukrainian, Bulgarian, Swedish, and Italian. That doesn’t mean I’m fluent in all of them. To give you a better idea of my level: in my "weakest" language, Italian, my listening comprehension is around a B1 on the CEFR scale. I can get by as a tourist without much trouble, though I might rely on a few "uhh"s and some pointing. In contrast, I can comfortably hold conversations and engage with complex, native-level content in Russian, German, Greek, Ukrainian, and Spanish. I’m somewhere in between with my French, Bulgarian, and Swedish.

With all of that out of the way, the first and most important thing to realize when learning a language is that it is not really a cognitive problem, it is more of a problem of *organization* and *habit formation*. Most people really can become fluent in a second language with enough *quality time* spent consuming and using the language. The key is to know what constitutes "*quality time*".
