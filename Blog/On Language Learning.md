### Why am I Writing This

Over the years I have had many conversations with people who find out how many languages I speak, and their responses usually fall into one of a handful of buckets. The most common is something along the lines of, "Oh wow! Some people are just made for languages," or, "Oh, I could never, I wish I had started young." Another is, "How do you find the time? Are you spending hours every day?" Usually I try to recommend to them the tools that I have used, and I spend time trying to convince them that with the right method they could learn another language too. However, I have the sense that I fail to adequately convey my ideas in those conversations, and I always feel a bit frustrated with how they go. This essay is my attempt to put all of my thoughts on the subject into one place, so that I can just point people to it in the future.

------------------

Imagine you decide to learn Spanish in your free time. Maybe you took a couple of levels of Spanish in school when you were younger. You had hopes that by congugating enough verbs or memorizing vocabulary lists you would be dancing the tango (badly) and seducing everyone around you with your sweet, [insert Spanish-speaking country here] accent. You saw an ad for Duolingo that made you feel bad about yourself for not putting in the work you should have put in. You decide, "okay, that's it. I'm **finally** going to learn Spanish". You download the app. You spend a few months building a streak by translating sentences like "Roberto sits on the platypus". You feel good. You feel like you can finish those lessons quicker and quicker. Then you go to a taquer√≠a and realize you don't even know where to start in holding any practical conversation. Okay, no problem. You hire a tutor. You start doing homework every week and starting to speak. But it is painful, it is embarrasing and it hurts your brain. "I don't have time for this crap", you tell yourself. "Maybe if I had a year off I could finally dedicate the time and space I need to learn this". You put it aside, **yet again**. You read some blog posts about how the optimal time to learn a language is when you are in the womb, or better yet, starting at conception. You scroll TikTok and see videos of people rubbing their success in your face. You feel dejected. Luckily, you happen to stumble upon this intersting blog called Christo Notes and see a post titled "On Language Learning"...

There are many people with many opinions on the "correct" way to learn a language. A lot of them post or make videos on the internet. If you are trying, or have tried in the past, to learn a language, I'm sure you have encountered some of this content. Some of it is narrowly useful, some of it is engagement bait, but none of it really gets to the heart of what really allows someone to be succesful in learning a language. The short answer is that success is approximately proportional to *quality* time spent engaging with the language. Of course, saying that doesn't really help anyone understand what to *do*, so I will try to give a longer, more nuanced perspective that can hopefully be of some use.

I speak from experience. As a native English speaker, I've learned nine languages. After taking my childhood Russian exposure to fluency, I added Spanish, German, French, Greek, Ukrainian, Bulgarian, Swedish, and Italian. My levels range widely: from functional tourist level in Italian (around B1 listening comprehension on the CEFR scale) to comfortably handling complex conversations and native media in Russian, German, Greek, Ukrainian, and Spanish. My French, Bulgarian, and Swedish sit somewhere in between.

With all of that out of the way, the first and most important thing to realize when learning a language is that it is not really a cognitive problem, it is more of a problem of *organization* and *habit formation*. Most people really can become fluent in a second language with enough *quality time* spent consuming and using the language. The key is to know what constitutes *quality time*.
### Quality Time

What do I mean by *quality time*? Well, it differs depending on where you are in your journey. For simplicity, we can break things up into *beginning*, *intermediate*, and *advanced* stages. The *beginning* stage also has subcategories. You could have no experience at all in the language, not even understanding the writing system. You could also have a bit of a head start, for example if the language shares an alphabet with your's, or you had some classes a long time ago but retained (almost) nothing. Regardless of what stage you are at, we can define *quality time* as something like "time spent either consuming or producing the language at or slightly above your current level". If you are a beginner this could mean learning the writing system or using some simple Duolingo-esque app. If you are intermediate this could mean listening to a podcast where you understand approximately 70% to 80% of what you are hearing. It could mean reading a news article and looking up phrases and words you don't know. If you are advanced it could mean an hour long session speaking to a native speaker about anything that interests you. The point is that the time you are spending needs to not be a complete waste of your energy or resources. 

Some examples of time spent that is (usually) a waste include: reading a chapter of a grammar book (unless you really enjoy it), using Duolingo if it has already become easy for you, speaking to a structured tutor who has you do weekly assignments, filling in sentences and vocabulary lists, etc. What all of these activities have in common is they don't match the language input (or output) with one's current level in the language. You want to be putting in time in a way that allows you to consume or produce the maximum amount of words and sentences of actual genuine content in the language. 

### Total Time Spent

This part is the easiest to explain, and the hardest to implement. Success can be thought of in roughly these terms.
$$
success = total\ time\ spent \times quality\ of\ time\ spent
$$
There are a lot of factors that go in to determining how much time you spend learning a language, but the biggest factor ***by far*** is how much you enjoy doing it. 

In the beginning stages, enjoyment can come from more mundane activities, like vocabulary flashcards or gamified apps, since most of what you are encountering is new and it feels exciting to embark on the journey. You can easily create a habit for yourself of spending 10-20 minutes per day devoted to the language, and things feel easy and great. 

Then you hit a wall around 4 months in. You don't know what to do. The things you are doing are too easy and starting to get boring. Harder content is way too difficult. You see no way how to get from A to B. You quit. Again.

I will spend quite a bit of time explaining how to specifically overcome this, but it really does boil down to finding ways to make consuming authentic material fun and novel.


## Practical Guide Begins Here

### Place Yourself

Now that we have established the importance of *quality time* and *total time spent*, we can move on to some more practical advice. 

Where do you fall?

**Super beginner**: no experience, target language is very different than your native language. Examples include English speaker wanting to learn Japanese or Arabic. Mongolian speaker wanting to learn Igbo. You get the idea...

**Beginner**: little to no experience, target language is the same alphabet as your native langauge. Examples include English speaker wanting to learn Spanish, Russian speaker wanting to learn Bulgarian, etc. Maybe you have spent a little time with some language learning apps and can understand basic sentence construction. 

**Intermediate**: This is a wide range, and pretty vague. This is where most dedicated organized people end up falling off. If you can read simple sentences and articles and understand them without translating every single word, you are probably here. At the higher end of this range is the ability to listen to podcasts and pretty much follow most things, but easily lose track on super native authentic content that is fast. Maybe you can understand most things that are said to you, but when you watch a TV show or a movie in the language you get lost, but can follow a bit if there are subtitles. 

**Advanced**: At the advanced level, you probably won't get much from reading this essay. So I will just emphasize that at this stage it is all about consuming the maximum amount of enjoyable content. Watch movies, talk to native speakers, write essays, whatever you want to do, just ***keep doing it***. Actually, you will find that this advice isn't that different at a high level from the advice I give to intermediate learners, but the specifics matter a lot for how to actually implement it at each level. Intermediate requires a bit more creativity and guidance, whereas advanced learners have maximum freedom to enjoy whatever they want.
