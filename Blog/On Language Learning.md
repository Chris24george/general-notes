Imagine you decide to learn Spanish in your free time. Maybe you took a couple of levels of Spanish in school when you were younger. You had hopes that by congugating enough verbs or memorizing vocabulary lists you would be dancing the tango (badly) and seducing everyone around you with your sweet, [insert Spanish-speaking country here] accent. You saw an ad for Duolingo that made you feel bad about yourself for not putting in the work you should have put in. You decide, "okay, that's it. I'm **finally** going to learn Spanish". You download the app. You spend a few months building a streak by translating sentences like "Roberto sits on the platypus". You feel good. You feel like you can finish those lessons quicker and quicker. Then you go to a taquería and realize you don't even know where to start in holding any practical conversation. Okay, no problem. You hire a tutor. You start doing homework every week and starting to speak. But it is painful, it is embarrasing and it hurts your brain. "I don't have time for this crap", you tell yourself. "Maybe if I had a year off I could finally dedicate the time and space I need to learn this". You put it aside, **yet again**. You read some blog posts about how the optimal time to learn a language is when you are in the womb, or better yet, starting at conception. You scroll TikTok and see videos of people rubbing their success in your face. You feel dejected. Luckily, you happen to stumble upon this intersting blog called Christo Notes and see a post titled "On Language Learning"...

There are many people with many opinions on the "correct" way to learn a language. A lot of them post or make videos on the internet. If you are trying, or have tried in the past, to learn a language, I'm sure you have encountered some of this content. Some of it is narrowly useful, some of it is engagement bait, but none of it really gets to the heart of what really allows someone to be succesful in learning a language. The short answer is that success is approximately proportional to *quality* time spent engaging with the language. Of course, saying that doesn't really help anyone understand what to *do*, so I will try to give a longer, more nuanced perspective that can hopefully be of some use.

First of all, I know what I am talking about. I have learned (to varying degrees of fluency) 9 languages on my own. I am a native English Speaker. I have spoken and understood Russian since childhood, but I was never really fluent until I took the initiative to bring my level to fluency as a teenager. After Russian, I went on to study Spanish, German, French, Greek, Ukrainian, Bulgarian, Swedish, and Italian. That doesn’t mean I’m fluent in all of them. To give you a better idea of my level: in my "weakest" language, Italian, my listening comprehension is around a B1 on the CEFR scale. I can get by as a tourist without much trouble, though I might rely on a few "uhh"s and some pointing. In contrast, I can comfortably hold conversations and engage with complex, native-level content in Russian, German, Greek, Ukrainian, and Spanish. I’m somewhere in between with my French, Bulgarian, and Swedish.

With all of that out of the way, the first and most important thing to realize when learning a language is that it is not really a cognitive problem, it is more of a problem of *organization* and *habit formation*. Most people really can become fluent in a second language with enough *quality time* spent consuming and using the language. The key is to know what constitutes *quality time*.
### Quality Time

What do I mean by *quality time*? Well, it differs depending on where you are in your journey. For simplicity, we can break things up into *beginning*, *intermediate*, and *advanced* stages. The *beginning* stage also has subcategories. You could have no experience at all in the language, not even understanding the writing system. You could also have a bit of a head start, for example if the language shares an alphabet with your's, or you had some classes a long time ago but retained (almost) nothing. Regardless of what stage you are at, we can define *quality time* as something like "time spent either consuming or producing the language at or slightly above your current level". If you are a beginner this could mean learning the writing system or using some simple Duolingo-esque app. If you are intermediate this could mean listening to a podcast where you understand approximately 70% to 80% of what you are hearing. It could mean reading a news article and looking up phrases and words you don't know. If you are advanced it could mean an hour long session speaking to a native speaker about anything that interests you. The point is that the time you are spending needs to not be a complete waste of your energy or resources. 

Some examples of time spent that is (usually) a waste include: reading a chapter of a grammar book (unless you really enjoy it), using Duolingo if it has already become easy for you, speaking to a structured tutor who has you do weekly assignments, filling in sentences and vocabulary lists, etc. What all of these activities have in common is they don't match the language input (or output) with one's current level in the language. You want to be putting in time in a way that allows you to consume or produce the maximum amount of words and sentences of actual genuine content in the language. 

### Total Time Spent

This part is the easiest to explain, and the hardest to implement. Success can be thought of in roughly these terms.
$$
success = total\ time\ spent \times quality\ of\ time\ spent
$$
There are a lot of factors that go in to determining how much time you spend learning a language, but the biggest factor ***by far*** is how much you enjoy doing it. 

In the beginning stages, enjoyment can come from more mundane activities, like vocabulary flashcards or gamified apps, since most of what you are encountering is new and it feels exciting to embark on the journey. You can easily create a habit for yourself 

### Place Yourself

Now that we have established what *quality time* and *total time spent* mean, we can move on to some more
